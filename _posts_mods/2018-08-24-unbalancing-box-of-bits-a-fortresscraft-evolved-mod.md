### Unbalancing Box of Bits is a FortressCraft Evolved mod with the goal of adding more machines and items that make some sense within the design of the game.

However.

This mod will also include unbalancing and potentially compatibility breaking changes. One of these changes are converting Minecarts to be stackable.   

Do not remove this mod from an existing save otherwise you will risk corrupting your save. Please be aware that I do not guarantee 100% compatibility with other mods.
